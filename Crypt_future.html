            <h4><p>More of our personal lives and business activities are being conducted online than ever, making cybersecurity a key 
            issue of our time. Understanding what the future of cybersecurity is will show you how to make the best use of your 
            resources and stay safe not just today, but tomorrow too. 
            The future of cybersecurity is hard to predict because the industry is constantly evolving in response to the shifting behaviors of cybercriminals and the new attacks they develop.</p> 
            <br><br>
            <p>Here’s some insights from industry insiders on what they think the future of cybersecurity will look like:</p></h4>
            <br>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.disruptordaily.com/">“The future of cybersecurity will be largely determined by what hackers 
            will be after. 
            And I think this will primarily be in two areas: Health and Wealth. More specifically, this means private healthcare-related 
            data and sensitive payment information. Private health records can be worth a fortune. Credit card data can be used for fraud 
            or sold on the black market.” (John Shin, Managing Director at RSI Security)</blockquote>
            <br>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.disruptordaily.com/">“Hackers will continue to be more sophisticated, using new methods and tools 
            to gain access to private information. At the same time, technology will continue to evolve, providing hackers with an even 
            larger attack surface and more vulnerabilities to exploit. Even unsophisticated hackers will automate their strategies in their 
            efforts to infiltrate vulnerable companies. Hackers will also take advantage of the fact that companies increasingly rely on 
            their supply chains and will target popular third-party tools, suppliers and companies as a way to breach as many targets as 
            possible.
            To defend against such cyberattacks, companies will need to use more effective security solutions with innovative approaches. 
            For instance, companies will assess their cybersecurity as seen from the hacker’s point of view. The goal will be to not only 
            increase cyber resilience internally within their specific company, but also across the company’s supply chain.” (Matan Or-El, 
            co-founder and CEO of Panorays)
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.disruptordaily.com/">“The future of cyber security practice is very bright! As software systems
            and applications get more complex, the potential for cyber vulnerabilities and gaps will increase exponentially. Furthermore,
            as more and more high-value information (such as health information, contract data, financial data, etc.) is collected, 
            stored and shared through connected cyber environments over the next decade and beyond, the need for cyber security expertise
            will explode to combat the expected concurrent increase in cyber hacking and criminal activity.” (Sarbari Gupta, PhD, CISSP,
            CISA, President & CEO of Electrosoft Services)</blockquote>

            <h2 style="text-align: center">An Emerging Threat: Quantum Computers</h2><br><br>
            <h4>
                 <p>It’s the year 2035: Quantum computers are capable of cracking all of the public-key algorithms that provided 
                    protection for sensitive data back in 2019. Hackers use quantum computers to access information in private emails, 
                    while state authorities use them to obtain data belonging to suspicious institutions. Debit card payments are no 
                    longer possible, and trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is vulnerable to attack.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This scenario seems unrealistic from our current perspective. Researchers predict, however, that in ten to
                    fifteen years there will be functioning quantum computers capable of calculating mathematical problems such 
                    as the prime factorization of very large numbers millions of times faster than today’s normal computers. And 
                    those quantum computers would be able to crack encryption methods which we now believe to be secure. How 
                    realistic is this prediction, and what does it mean for the IT security industry?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Normal computers store information in the form of bits, which can assume two different states: 0 or 1. 
                    The computing speed of a normal computer depends on various aspects of the machine, including the number 
                    of processor cores and the sizes of the cache and memory. A quantum computer, on the other hand, calculates 
                    quantum bits, also known as qubits. Qubits can not only assume the states 0 and 1, but an infinite number of 
                    intermediate states as well. This principle is called superposition and arises from quantum mechanical effects
                    that are not yet fully understood. The qubits are in this superimposed state until they are measured.</p>
                <br>
                 <p>Although research on quantum computers has been going on for over 20 years, it has not yet been possible to 
                    develop a commercially usable quantum computer. Major institutions such as the NSA, Google, IBM and Microsoft 
                    are working to develop high-performance quantum computers. At the beginning of this year, IBM introduced a 
                    non-commercial quantum computer measuring 2.5 by 2.5 meters that operates on 20 qubits. A quantum computer with 
                    as few as 50 qubits would be faster than a supercomputer that uses many processors.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Protecting Data From Quantum Computers: Post-quantum Cryptography</h2><br><br>
            <h4>
                <p>Research is already being performed on new quantum-resistant encryption algorithms to prevent the decryption of 
                    methods that we have come to believe are secure. This area of research is called post-quantum cryptography. 
                    Established asymmetric public-key encryption methods such as RSA multiply large prime numbers together for their 
                    encryption. It would take normal computers decades to factorize the primes again, which is why the procedures were 
                    considered secure until now. However, an algorithm has already been developed for quantum computers that can 
                    factorize large numbers into prime factors and crack asymmetric encryption in a matter of minutes. Right now, 
                    this algorithm exists only in theory, since quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to run it. The number of
                    qubits needed to quickly crack asymmetric encryption methods is fairly well known: Between 2,300 and 4,000.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The development of quantum-resistant encryption methods shows that the threat posed by quantum computers is 
                    being taken seriously. However, when and whether quantum computers will be operational at all is completely 
                    unclear. According to a May 2018 study entitled The State of Development of Quantum Computers published by 
                    the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), because of the high cost of error correction, 
                    it is “in the foreseeable future unlikely, and probably also economically unattractive, for academic and 
                    industrial laboratories to realize a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.” For intelligence agencies, 
                    however, this development may indeed prove more relevant. How realistic the quantum-computing threat is depends 
                    on how much progress is made in the development of quantum computers and on what effective, quantum-resistant 
                    encryption methods are being developed.</p>
